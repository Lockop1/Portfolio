                      I'm Anthony Newsome, a software developer who has always loved 
                      building things. I started when I was ten, using an app called 
                      Tynker to make small games, including one that reached over 
                      100,000 views and led to a feature on their blog. That 
                      encouragement pushed me into Minecraft modding with ID
                      Tech where I learned Java, then into Processing, and 
                      eventually Unity.<br/><br/>
                      Over the years, I spent countless hours 
                      experimenting with mechanics, systems, and ideas simply because 
                      I was curious. I worked on larger projects, participated in game 
                      jams, and gradually expanded into web development through 
                      freeCodeCamp. That journey ultimately led me to build this site 
                      as a space to showcase what I enjoy creating and where I’m headed next.

                      I learn by building and experimenting. I spend most of my time 
                      exploring programming through game development and web projects, 
                      using prototypes to understand how systems work and how small decisions 
                      affect behavior and feel.<br/><br/>
                      I enjoy the process of iteration and debugging, treating it as a form 
                      of refinement where rough ideas slowly turn into something intentional. 
                      Whether I’m working in Unity or on the web, I focus on learning deeply, 
                      improving my fundamentals, and steadily raising the quality of my work 
                      over time.

                      What sets me apart is how deeply curiosity drives everything I do. 
                      I don’t just enjoy building things. I enjoy understanding why they 
                      work, how small changes affect behavior, and what happens when 
                      systems are pushed, broken, and rebuilt. That mindset shows up in 
                      how I code, how I debug, and how I approach learning new technologies.<br/><br/>
                      I’m naturally drawn to challenge and exploration, both inside and 
                      outside of programming. Snowboarding, traveling, and discovering 
                      new places fuel the same instincts that lead me to start new projects 
                      or experiment with unfamiliar ideas. I’m comfortable being a beginner, 
                      and I see uncertainty as an invitation to learn rather than something 
                      to avoid. <br/><br/>
                      Equally important to me is community and connection. Some of my most 
                      meaningful growth has come from collaborating with others, sharing 
                      ideas, and learning from people with different backgrounds and 
                      perspectives. I care about building things that people can engage 
                      with, learn from, or simply enjoy, and I’m motivated by the idea that 
                      thoughtful technology can have a positive impact on how people experience 
                      the world.

Most of my work starts as experiments, where the goal is to understand how a system behaves rather than to rush toward a finished release.\n A large part of my process is iteration and debugging. I enjoy breaking systems apart, tracing issues, and refining behavior until a mechanic feels responsive and deliberate. Even when a project stays small, I treat each system as its own product, polishing it until it works exactly the way I intend.\n Through this approach, I’ve built experience across 2D and 3D projects, player movement, core mechanics, and gameplay logic, while continuously expanding my understanding of programming and game design.",

Much of my work here comes from building small-scale projects that let me explore how ideas translate into usable digital experiences.\n I’m especially interested in how motion, hierarchy, and subtle feedback guide a user’s attention. I like refining details, adjusting spacing, timing, and behavior until a page feels balanced and purposeful. This portfolio itself reflects that process, evolving through constant adjustment and hands-on problem solving.\n Rather than chasing trends or finished products, I focus on strengthening my understanding of how the web works from the ground up.

I proposed Chicago AI Week 2030 as a strategic opportunity, which was approved by leadership, and attended the conference. This gave me exposure to high-level conversations and the pace of real sales cycles. I sent follow-ups to coordinate demos and meetings, while connecting with decision-makers across technical and executive roles.\n Through this work, I developed practical skills in communication, organization, and project coordination. I learned how to tailor messaging, track progress, and collaborate across teams, and I gained confidence operating at the intersection of technology and business. That perspective now informs how I think about building products that solve real problems and communicate value clearly.",
